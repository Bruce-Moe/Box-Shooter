# Box-Shooter
My Box Shooter Game inspired from Michigan State's Coursera Game Dev Course   
To run the game:  
1. Download and extract the project file
2. Go to the Builds->WebGL folder
3. Run the index.html file in a browser that supports Unity, such as Firefox. You may need to change browser settings to allow Unity.
