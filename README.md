My Box Shooter Game inspired from Michigan State's Coursera Game Dev Course   

To run the game:

Rules:  
- To beat level 1, score 100 points. To beat level 2, score 2000 points   
- Shooting green cubes gives 5 points  
- Shooting white cubes adds 3 seconds to the time  
- Shooting yellow cubes takes away 5 seconds from the time  
- Shooting purple spheres in the second level multiplies the amount of points earned from shooting green cubes    
- The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible before time runs out
